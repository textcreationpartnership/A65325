            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The following Methods being obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. A Strict Prohibition of the Exportation of <hi>White Cloaths,</hi> will very much improve our Trade both at Home and Abroad, it being well known that there hath been year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſported by <hi>Bayes, Northern Kerſies, &amp;c.</hi> above 200000 Cloaths, or Pieces, which hath been carried to the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi> and there Dreſſed, Dyed and Shipped to <hi>Spain, Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, &amp;c.</hi> So it is obvious, were they Dreſſed and Dyed at Home, a mighty Advantage would accrew to the Merchants in Importing, Buying and Selling of Dye-Stuff, and to the Subjects in general, in preparing ſuch materials, Dying, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Packing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To prove that an Impoſition on the <hi>Woolen Manufacture</hi> will not be Grievous but Advantageous, it is well known in Trade, that a Riſe on a <hi>Commodity</hi> is an Advantage to the Retayler.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By having of our <hi>Cloaths, Stuffs, Stockins, Hats,</hi> &amp;c. care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Sealed by Officers appointed for that purpoſe, with a Diſtinction between the <hi>Right Good</hi> and what is <hi>Defective,</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſevere Penalty on any Officer that neglects his Duty, will give great Reputation to the <hi>Manufactory</hi> abroad, as well as a general Advantage to the Subjects at Home.</p>
            <p>A Rebate, or Draw-back, may be made out of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-Houſe</hi> to part, or the whole paid on the Account of this Impoſition, as it ſhall ſeem meet to your Honours, by which means the Merchants may ſell his Goods in any
<pb facs="tcp:38037:2"/>Foreign parts, as if the Impoſition was not laid, and to a greater Reputation, the Goods being as before Examined, ſo that the Tax will only lie at Home.</p>
            <p>That all Drapers, Cloathiers, Factors, Hoſiers, Hatters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pay the Duty impoſed within <gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈1 span left blank〉</desc>
               </gap> weeks after an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count taken of all the preſent ſtock of Goods they have Ready-made, they cannot put a ſtop to the preſent Trade, which otherwiſe they may do to their own private Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, this will raiſe his Majeſty a great Summ of Ready-money for his preſent Occaſion; and this will be no more Loſs to the Draper, Clothier, Hoſier, Hatter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the ſealed Paper is to the Lawyers and Attornies who are paid by their Clients. We find in the laſt Seſſions of Parliament, that there was a Motion made touching this <hi>Impoſition,</hi> but nothing coming to perfection (as we have been informed) for want of Particulars how to lay it, and how to gather the Tax; but we have for above theſe three Years laſt paſt been induſtrious to ſettle this point, ſome of the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Members of Parliament having had ſome of our Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars ſo long, and ſome ſince, as alſo ſome have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mens hands that have ſet up to be the firſt Contrivers, which know little of it. Therefore we think fit to inform your Honours, that we know the true uſe of the <hi>Wool</hi> to the beſt Advantage, from the Sheeps back, to the Clothier, Merchant and Retaler's hands, but are very unwilling to publiſh our Method for the uſe of other pretenders; but are ready to ſhew the Particulars where to lay it, and how to gather it, for the beſt Advantage for the King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, when this Honourable Houſe ſhall command us ſo to do, as likewiſe to Anſwer all manner of Objections.</p>
